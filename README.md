## Course Description
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language that allows you to control the appearance of your webpages. In this hands-on course, Christina Truong demonstrates the concepts that form the foundation of CSS, explaining what you need to know to tweak existing CSS and write your own.

Christina explains how to add colors and other design elements to take your webpages beyond just black text on a white background. She shows how to use selectors, how the box model defines the spacing and sizing of page elements, and how to style text and manage basic layouts with Flexbox and Grid. She also covers working with advanced selectors, creating fluid layouts, and determining when to use the float and position properties.

Plus, at the end of the course, you'll walk away with an actual project -- [an online résumé and portfolio page](https://christinatruong.github.io/css-essential-training/css-portfolio/).
